The host Indian board BCCI has not announced the final schedule yet. Teams usually plan and prepare depending on the World Cup schedule. But the parties are in the dark as they have not received it even in the last week of May.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BCCI said it will take a few more days to finalize the 2023 World Cup schedule. A special general meeting of the BCCI was held in Ahmedabad on Saturday. After the meeting, BCCI Secretary Jai Shah told the media, &#8216;The venue of the World Cup will be announced at a press conference during the final of the Test Championship. Then the complete schedule of the tournament will be published.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final of the ICC Test Championship will begin on June 7 at The Oval. India-Australia will face each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chandika Hathurusinghe, the head coach of the Bangladesh team, regretted not getting the World Cup schedule at the end of April. On the last day of the national team&#8217;s camp in Sylhet, whether the World Cup schedule was not announced was a problem, he said, &#8216;It is not only affecting us, it is affecting everyone. It is better if it is announced earlier. A little clearer idea is obtained.&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last ODI World Cup was held in England. Organized by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the tournament began on 31 May 2019. The schedule was released 400 days ago\u2014on April 26, 2018.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like last time, 10 teams are participating in the World Cup. Meanwhile, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand and Afghanistan have confirmed participation. The two teams will be finalized through the qualifiers, which will be held next month, in Zimbabwe. Among the 10 teams shortlisted are two former world champions West Indies and Sri Lanka and two full ICC members Zimbabwe and Ireland.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to various media reports, the possible start date of the 2023 World Cup is October 5, the final on November 19. England-New Zealand may face each other in the opening match.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are less than four and a half months left for the start of the World Cup.
